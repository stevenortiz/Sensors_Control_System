# Sensors_Control_System
The purpose of the Senior Design project from UNC-Charlotte and collaboration with Interroll is for a AC Drum-motor load testing applicator. To control and collect sensor data the team is using LabVIEW VIs. 
The purpose of using GitHub is to get introduced to software version control for multidisciplinary Senior Design Team. 

VIs in LabVIEW are Virtual Intruments that are composed of a block diagram and a front panel for UI. These subVIs can be combined to build a
Master VI for the entire system. 

The master VI folder will include all current working subVIs for our SD project so far. 

Other folders will include code that is in the testing phase.
